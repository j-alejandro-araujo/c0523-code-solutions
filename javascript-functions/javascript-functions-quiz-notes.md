## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  It's a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  Initialize using function keyword, followed by name, followed by parantheses, followed by curly braces where code to be executed will be stored.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  Function name + parantheses will call/invoke.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function definition is where the code block to be executed is created and stored, and a function call invokes the function and actually runs the code block.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder whose value is not known until we call the function and pass the arguement.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  It allows a function to perform tasks without knowing the specific input values ahead of time.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It returns a value + stops the execution of a function.
