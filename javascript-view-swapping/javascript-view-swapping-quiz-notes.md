After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the `event.target`?
  It's a property tht represents the DOM element that triggered an event and can be utilized for event delegation.
- What is the affect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  It'll make that element invisible.
- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  It takes a selector as it's argument and returns a boolean value of true or false.
- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  By utilizing getAttribute() method.
- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  After querying the DOM for elements.
- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your JavaScript code be written instead?
  You'd need to add more code to account for each tab including any new ones added in the future.
